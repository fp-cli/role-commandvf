Running tests
-------------

There are two types of tests:

* unit tests, implemented using [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/)
* functional tests, implemented using [Behat](http://behat.org)

All the test dependencies can be installed using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

    composer.phar install --dev

Before running the tests, you'll need a MySQL user called `wp_cli_test` with the
password `password1` that has full privileges on the MySQL database `wp_cli_test`.
Running the following as root in MySQL should do the trick:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wp_cli_test.* TO "wp_cli_test"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "password1";

Finally, to run the unit tests:

    vendor/bin/phpunit

And to run the functional tests:

    vendor/bin/behat
