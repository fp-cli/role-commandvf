Contributing
============

Welcome and thanks!

We appreciate you taking the initiative to contribute to WP-CLI. It’s because of you, and the community around you, that WP-CLI is such a great project.

**Contributing isn’t limited to just code.** We encourage you to contribute in the way that best fits your abilities, by writing tutorials, giving a demo at your local meetup, helping other users with their support questions, or revising our documentation.

Please take a moment to read these guidelines at depth. Following the guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the other contributors to the project. In turn, they’ll do their best to reciprocate that respect when working with you, across timezones and around the world.

### Reporting a bug

Think you’ve found a bug? We’d love for you to help us get it fixed.

Before you create a new issue, you should [search existing issues](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Abug%20) to see if there’s an existing resolution to it, or if it’s already been fixed in a newer version of WP-CLI. You should also check our [documentation on common issues and their fixes](https://wp-cli.org/docs/common-issues/).

Once you’ve done a bit of searching and discovered there isn’t an open or fixed issue for your bug, please [follow our guidelines for submitting a bug report](http://wp-cli.org/docs/bug-reports/) to make sure it gets addressed in a timely manner.

### Creating a pull request

Want to contribute a new feature? WP-CLI is a mature project, and already chock-full of useful functionality. Please first [open a new issue](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/new) to discuss whether the feature is a good fit for WP-CLI core, or might be better suited as a [community package](https://wp-cli.org/package-index/).

Once you've decided to commit the time to seeing your pull request through, please [follow our guidelines for creating a pull request](https://wp-cli.org/docs/pull-requests/) to make sure it's a pleasant experience.

### Contributing in other ways

Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/new) with your question, and we'll see if we can find an answer for it.

Alternatively, if you have a WordPress.org account, you may also consider joining the `#cli` channel on the [WordPress.org Slack organization](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).
